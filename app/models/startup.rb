# Welcome to Silicon Valley! For this assignment, our domain is the startup world! We have three models - `Startup`, `VentureCapitalist`, and `FundingRound`. A `Startup` has many `VentureCapitalist`s through `FundingRound`s.
# If you are not sketching out your domain, and thinking about single source of truth,
# you are doing it wrong :(

# - `Startup#name`
#   - returns a **string** that is the startup's name
# - `Startup#founder`
#   - returns a **string** that is the founder's name
#   - Once a startup is created, the founder cannot be changed.
# - `Startup#domain`
#   - returns a **string** that is the startup's domain
#   - Once a startup is created, the domain cannot be changed.
# - `Startup#pivot`
#   - given a string of a **domain** and a string of a **name**, change the domain and name of the startup
# - `Startup.all`
#   - should return **all** of the startup instances
# - `Startup.find_by_founder`
#   - given a string of a **founder's name**, returns the **first startup** whose founder's name matches
# - `Startup.domains`
#   - should return an **array** of all of the different startup domains
